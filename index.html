      <h1> Romans Study </h1>

      <h2> About </h2>

      <p>
        An in-depth study of the Book of Romans over 8 weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the perspective of systematic theology, Romans is quite possibly the most important book in the Bible.
        However, the substantial scope and complexity of Romans makes it challenging to study in a casual community-group setting or sermon series.
      <p/>
      <p>
        This study is intended to address that lacuna.
        In contrast to typical church community group, this is a "high-effort" Bible study that runs for a relatively short time period.
        The expectation is that everyone will have already read the week's passage one or more times and will arrive ready to discuss it.
      <p/>
      <p>
        Space is limited.
